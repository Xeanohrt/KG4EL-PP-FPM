# Knowledge Graph for Event Log Preprocessing in Federated Process Mining (KG4EL-PP-FPM#)
## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the IT artefact of the author's master thesis examining how knowledge graphs can be leveraged to support the construction of a federated event log from multiple Process Aware Information Systems (PAIS) for interorganizational process mining (Federated Process Mining), addressing challenges in event log data and preprocessing. 

The aim was to understand how the knowledge graph-driven approach to preprocess event logs, can support the acitivites during the event data extraction, transformation, and integration of heterogeneous data sources (representing single event logs) into a homogeneous, structured format (the merged federated event log). The approach combines semantic technologies concepts, graph databases, and event log preprocessing to harmonize diverse event data fields. 

The developed IT artifact can identify data quality issues and enables comparison of event logs, thus providing a blueprint for building high-quality federated event logs collaboratively. Finally, the research maps out steps for creating a homogeneous merged distributed event log in alignment with the federated process mining model type I by Van der Aalst (2021).

Intra- and Inter-Organizational Process Mining focuses on discovering processes within and between
organizations. Van der Aalst states that a process either can be partitioned vertically or horizontally across organisations.
